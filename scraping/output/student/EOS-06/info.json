This is to provide continuity services of Oceansat-2 spacecraft with enhanced payload specifications as well as application areas. Payloads Ocean Color Monitor (OCM-3) Sea Surface Temperature Monitor (SSTM) Ku-Band Scatterometer (SCAT-3) ARGOS More Details PSLV-C54/EOS-06 Mission EOS-06 EOS-06 First Day EOS-06 images Cyclone Mandous and detects Algal Bloom Global false colour composite mosaic generated from EOS-06 data Gallery PSLV-C54 Satellite Activity and Assembly Video Teaser Video Launch of PSLV-C54/EOS-06 Mission Brochure - English PDF - 8.11 MB Live Launch Gallery Mission Objectives To ensure the data continuity of Ocean colour and wind vector data to sustain the operational applications. To improve the applications, some additional datasets such as Sea Surface Temperature and more number of bands in Optical region for florescence and in Infrared region for atmospheric corrections are accommodated. To develop / improve related algorithms and data products to serve in well- established application areas and to enhance the mission utility.
