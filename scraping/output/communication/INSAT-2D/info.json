    "Back to ISRO Timeline INSAT": "2D, identical to INSAT-2C, was launched on June 4, 1997 but the satellite became in-operable since October 4, 1997 following a power bus anomaly and associated problems. Hence it was replaced by in-orbit satellite, ARABSAT-1C, designated as INSAT-2DT. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 2079 Kg मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : Seven years(nominal) शक्ति / Power: 1650 Watts Ariane-44L H10-3 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Communication निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Communication कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: GSO (Geosynchronous Orbit) Mission Communication Weight 2079 kg with propellants, 995 kg dry weight onboard power 1650 Watts Communication C, extended C, S and Ku bands Stabilization Three axis stabilized with two Momentum Wheels & one Reaction Wheel, Magnetic torquers Propulsion Integrated bipropellan stystem ( MMH and N2 04) With sixteen 22N thrusters and 440N LAM.
