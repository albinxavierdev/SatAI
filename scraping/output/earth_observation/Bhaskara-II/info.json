    "The main objectives of Bhaskara": "II, similar to Bhaskara-I, were to conduct earth observation experiments for applications related to hydrology, forestry, and geology using the two band television camera system operating in the 0.54 to 0.66 microns visible band and 0.75 to 0.85 micron near infra red band and to conduct ocean-surface studies using Satellite Microwave Radiometer (SAMIR) operating at 19.35, 22.235 & 31.4 GHz frequency band Successful operation during mission life. Despite the problem faced by one of the two onboard cameras, sent more than two thousand images which were used for many studies. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 444 kg मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : One year (nominal) शक्ति / Power: 47 W C-1 Intercosmos उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Earth Observation निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Earth Observation Experimental कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Mission Experimental Remote Sensing Weight 444 kg onboard power 47 Watts Communication VHF band Stabilization Spin stabilized (spin axis controlled) Payload TV cameras, three band Microwave Radiometer (SAMIR) Launch date Nov 20, 1981 Launch site Volgograd Launch Station (presently in Russia) Launch vehicle C-1 Intercosmos Orbit 541 x 557 km Inclination 50.7 o Mission life One year (nominal) Orbital Life About 10 years ( Re-entered in 1991 )"
