    "PSLV": "C5 is the eighth flight of ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV. Since its first flight in 1993, the payload capability of PSLV has been progressively improved by more than 600 kg. PSLV has also launched multiple satellites. In PSLV-C5 mission, the vehicle launches an Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS-P6 (RESOURCESAT-1), weighing 1360 kg into an 817 km high polar Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). With six successive successful launches so far, PSLV has emerged as the workhorse launch vehicle of ISRO for launching satellites into SSO as well as Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). PSLV is also offered for launching satellites of other space agencies /countries through the Antrix Corporation Limited.
