    "Back to ISRO Timeline GSAT": "10, India’s advanced communication satellite, is a high power satellite being inducted into the INSAT system. Weighing 3400 kg at lift-off, GSAT-10 is configured to carry 30 communication transponders in normal C-band, lower extended C-band and Ku-band as well as a GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) payload operating in L1 and L5 bands. GSAT-10 is the second satellite to carry GAGAN payload after GSAT-8, which is already providing navigation services from orbit. GSAT-10 also carries a Ku-band beacon to help in accurately pointing ground antennas towards the satellite. The 30 communication transponders onboard GSAT-10 will further augment the capacity in the INSAT system. The GAGAN payload provides the Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS), through which the accuracy of the positioning information obtained from the GPS satellites is improved by a network of ground based receivers and made available to the users in the country through geo-stationary satellites. PAYLOADS OF GSAT-10 COMMUNICATION PAYLOADS 12 Ku-band transponders each with 36 Mhz usable bandwidth employing 140 W Travelling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) with footprint covering Indian mainland with an Edge of Coverage Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) of 51.5 dBW and Andaman & Nicobar islands with an EIRP of 49.5 dBW 12 C-band transponders each with 36 MHz usable bandwidth employing 32 W TWTA with footprint covering Indian mainland and West Asia with an Edge of Coverage EIRO of 40 dBW 6 Lower Extended C-band transponders each with 36 MHz usable bandwidth employing 32 W TWTA with footprint covering Indian mainland and island territories with an Edge of Coverage EIRP of 38 dBW and 37 dBW respectively NAVIGATION PAYLOAD Two-channel GAGAN payload operating in L1 and L5 bands provides Satellite-based Navigation services with accuracy and integrity required for civil aviation applications over Indian Air Space. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 3400 kg आयाम / Dimension: 2.0 m X 1.77 m X 3.1 m cuboid मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : 15 Years शक्ति / Power: 6474 Watts Ariane-5 VA-209 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Communication निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Communication Navigation कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: GEO Mission Communication Weight 3400 kg (Mass at Lift – off) 1498 kg (Dry Mass) Power Solar array providing 6474 Watts (at Equinox) and two 128 AH Lithium-Ion batteries Physical Dimensions 2.0 m X 1.77 m X 3.1 m cuboid Propulsion 440 Newton Liquid Apogee Motors (LAM) with Mono Methyl Hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and Mixed oxides of Nitrogen (MON-3) as oxidizer for orbit raising.
