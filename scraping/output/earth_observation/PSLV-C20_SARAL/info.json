    "s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in its twenty third flight (PSLV": "C20), launches the Indo-French satellite SARAL along with six commercial payloads from Canada, Austria, Denmark and UK into a 785 km polar sun synchronous orbit inclined at an angle of 98.538 deg to the equator. PSLV-C20 was launched on Feb 25, 2013 from the First Launch Pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR (SDSC SHAR), Sriharikota. With a lift-off mass of 407 kg, SARAL is the 56th satellite launched by PSLV. The six payloads from abroad together have a lift-off mass of 259.5 kg. PSLV-C20 is the ninth flight of PSLV in 'Core-Alone' configuration (without solid strap-on motors).
