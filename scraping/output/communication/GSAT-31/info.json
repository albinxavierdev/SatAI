Weighing about 2536 kg, GSAT-31 will provide continuity to operational services on some of the in-orbit satellites. The satellite derives its heritage from ISRO’s earlier INSAT/GSAT satellite series. The satellite provides Indian mainland and island coverage. The designed in-orbit operational life of GSAT-31 is about 15 years. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 2536 kg मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : 15 Years Ariane-5 VA-247 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Communication निर्माता / Manufacturer: इसरो / ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: इसरो / ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Communication कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: GTO More Details GSAT-31 Mission GSAT-31 Gallery Launch Kit Brochure PDF - 5608 KB GSAT-31 Curtain Raiser (English) GSAT-31 Curtain Raiser (Hindi) More Details GSAT-31 Gallery Launch Kit Brochure PDF - 5608 KB GSAT-31 Curtain Raiser (English) GSAT-31 Curtain Raiser (hindi)"
