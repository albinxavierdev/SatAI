# Vedika ‚Äì AI Chatbot for ISRO Satellite Data
*A structured development roadmap*

---

## Overview
**Vedika** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide researchers, students, and professionals with accurate, context-aware answers about ISRO satellite datasets. It integrates historical archives (since 1986) and near-real-time satellite data into a single knowledge base (KB), enabling intelligent query handling such as comparisons, geospatial extents, and product details.

---

## Phase 1: Data Sourcing & Preparation
**Goal:** Collect, clean, and standardize both historical and live ISRO satellite data.  
- Register and access ISRO portals: **MOSDAC, Bhoonidhi, Bhuvan, VEDAS, ISDA**.  
- Gather **historical archives** (e.g., 1986 onward datasets from Bhoonidhi).  
- Set up feeds for **near-real-time products** (e.g., MOSDAC Live INSAT-3DS data, Bhuvan daily mosaics).  
- Collect **unstructured docs** (PDFs, brochures, manuals).  
- Clean and normalize:  
  - Standardize dates, spatial extents (GeoJSON), and satellite metadata.  
  - Tag historical vs. live data for clarity.  
- Validate against ISRO official docs.  

---

## Phase 2: Knowledge Base & Real-Time Updates
**Goal:** Build and maintain Vedika‚Äôs hybrid knowledge base (KB).  
- Structured storage: **PostgreSQL/SQLite** for satellite metadata.  
- Unstructured storage: **Vector DB (FAISS/Pinecone)** for semantic search of documents.  
- Index and embed: satellites, instruments, datasets, product manuals.  
- Automate **update pipelines**: cron jobs / schedulers to fetch new datasets daily/hourly.  
- Implement **monitoring & logging** for failures (API downtime, broken feeds).  
- Version control for scripts & timestamps to track freshness.  

---

## Phase 3: AI/NLP Integration
**Goal:** Enable Vedika to understand and respond to natural language queries.  
- **Entity recognition (spaCy/HF):** detect satellite names, instruments, geospatial terms.  
- **Intent classification (ML model):** distinguish query types (e.g., ‚Äúcompare satellites‚Äù, ‚Äúgive geospatial extent‚Äù, ‚Äúdownload data‚Äù).  
- **RAG pipeline setup:**  
  - Retrieve snippets from KB (vector search).  
  - Generate responses via LLM (fine-tuned on ISRO terminology).  
- Fine-tune/customize: add ISRO-specific vocab (e.g., INSAT payloads, EOS missions).  
- Context handling: maintain conversation history (LangChain memory).  

---

## Phase 4: Chatbot Development, Testing & Deployment
**Goal:** Deliver Vedika as a functional, user-facing AI chatbot.  
- Build **UI** (Streamlit or Gradio) ‚Üí simple, clean chat window.  
- Connect UI ‚Üí NLP backend ‚Üí KB.  
- Features:  
  - Query handling (‚ÄúCompare INSAT-3D vs. 3DS‚Äù).  
  - Conversation memory for follow-ups.  
  - Optional: voice mode, map/visual previews of geospatial data.  
- **Testing:** simulate live update events (new satellite data availability).  
- **Deployment:** containerize with Docker, deploy on **AWS/Heroku**.  
- Add **feedback loop:** log queries, refine answers, expand KB coverage.

## ‚ö° Capabilities of Vedika
Vedika is designed to be a **knowledge-driven, context-aware assistant** for ISRO satellite data. Its core capabilities include:

### 1. Satellite Knowledge & Metadata Access  
- Provides detailed information on **44+ ISRO satellites** (past and present).  
- Retrieves **launch dates, payload details, resolutions, coverage areas, and applications**.  
- Supports **comparisons** (e.g., *INSAT-3D vs. INSAT-3DS improvements*).  

### 2. Geospatial & Product Information  
- Answers queries about **geospatial extents**, coverage regions, and data availability.  
- Guides users to relevant **satellite products** (e.g., rainfall, SST, vegetation indices).  
- Converts technical metadata into **easy-to-understand summaries**.  

### 3. Historical & Real-Time Data Support  
- Accesses **archived data (since 1986)** through Bhoonidhi and other repositories.  
- Integrates with **real-time feeds** (e.g., MOSDAC Live meteorological products).  
- Maintains data freshness via **automated update pipelines**.  

### 4. Natural Language Query Understanding  
- Handles free-form questions like:  
  - *‚ÄúWhich satellites provide land use/land cover data?‚Äù*  
  - *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the resolution of Cartosat-2 imagery?‚Äù*  
- Detects **entities (satellite names, sensors, instruments)** and **intent** (compare, lookup, download).  
- Maintains **contextual conversation memory** for follow-ups.  

### 5. Knowledge Retrieval & AI-Powered Responses  
- Uses a **RAG pipeline** to fetch relevant info from structured KB + unstructured docs.  
- Generates **factually aligned, ISRO-specific responses**.  
- Explains technical terms (e.g., *‚ÄúTIR band‚Äù*) in simple language when needed.  

### 6. User-Friendly Interaction  
- Chat interface with **search + Q&A flow** (web/app based).  
- Optional **voice interaction mode** for accessibility.  
- Potential for **visual outputs** (map previews, charts, product diagrams).  

### 7. Scalability & Extensibility  
- Can integrate new satellites, missions, and APIs without redesign.  
- Future-ready for:  
  - **Multi-language support** (Hindi & regional).  
  - **API endpoints** for research labs & universities.  
  - **Satellite image previews** within chat.
