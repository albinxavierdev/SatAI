    "RESOURCESAT": "2 is a follow on mission to RESOURCESAT-1 and the eighteenth Remote Sensing satellite built by ISRO. RESOURCESAT-2 is intended to continue the remote sensing data services to global users provided by RESOURCESAT-1, and to provide data with enhanced multispectral and spatial coverage as well. Important changes in RESOURCESAT-2 compared to RESOURCESAT-1 are: Enhancement of LISS-4 multispectral swath from 23 km to 70 km and improved Radiometric accuracy from 7 bits to 10 bits for LISS-3 and LISS-4 and 10 bits to 12 bits for AWIFS. Besides, suitable changes, including miniaturisation in payload electronics, have been made in RESOURCESAT-2.

RESOURCESAT-2 carries two Solid State Recorders with a capacity of 200 Giga Bytes each to store the images taken by its cameras which can be read out later to ground stations. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 1206 kg मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : 5 years शक्ति / Power: 1250 W प्रमोचक राकेट / Launch Vehicle: PSLV-C16/RESOURCESAT-2 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Earth Observation निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Earth Observation कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: SSPO (Sun Synchronous Polar Orbit) Mission Remote Sensing Orbit Circular Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit altitude at injection 822 km + 20 km (3 Sigma) Orbit Inclination 98.731º + 0.2º Lift-off Mass 1206 kg Orbit Period 101.35 min Number of Orbits per day 14 Local Time of Equator crossing 10:30 am Repetivity 24 days Attitude and Orbit Control 3-axis body stabilised using Reaction Wheels, Magnetic Torquers and Hydrazine Thrusters Power Solar Array generating 1250 W at End Of Life, two 24 AH Ni-Cd batteries Launch date April 20, 2011 Launch site SHAR Centre Sriharikota India Launch vehicle PSLV- C16 Mission life 5 years More Details PSLV-C16/RESOURCESAT-2 RESOURCESAT-2 Gallery Brochure PDF - 2.37 MB"
