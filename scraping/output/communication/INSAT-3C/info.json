    "Back to ISRO Timeline INSAT": "3C, carrying Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) transponders, Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) transponders and Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) transponders is intended to continue the service of INSAT-2DT and INSAT-2C which were nearing their end to life besides improving and augmenting the INSAT system capacity. INSAT-3C is the second satellite of the INSAT-3 series. The first satellite, INSAT-3B was launched in March 2000. It provides the first set to transponders for Swaran Jayanti Vidya Vikas Antariksh Upagraha Yojana (Vidya Vahini) for interactive training and developmental communication giving fillip to the training and developmental Communication channel of INSAT. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 2,650 Kg मिशन कालावधि / Mission Life : Very long शक्ति / Power: 2765 W Ariane5-V147 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Communication निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Climate & Environment Communication कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: GSO (Geosynchronous Orbit) Mission Communication, broadcasting and Meteorology Spacecraft Mass 2,650 kg (Mass at Lift - off) 1218 kg (Dry mass) Onboard power 2765 W Propulsion Liquid Apogee Motor with fuel and oxidizer stored in separate titanium tanks and pressurant in Kevlar wound titanium tank.
