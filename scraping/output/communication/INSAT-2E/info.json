    "Back to ISRO Timeline INSAT": "2E, the last of the INSAT -2 series of satellites built by ISRO, is a multi - purpose satellite for telecommunication, television broadcasting and meteorological services. The very High Resolution Radiometer operates in three spectral bands with 2 km resolution in visible band and 8km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. The water vapour band has been introduced in the INSAT system for the first time. In addition, INSAT - 2E also carries a Charge Coupled Device Camera, again for the first time in the INSAT. This camera also operates in three spectral bands - visible, near infrared and short wave infrared - providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. प्रमोचन भार / Launch Mass: 2,550 Kg Ariane-42P H10-3 उपग्रह का प्रकार / Type of Satellite: Communication निर्माता / Manufacturer: ISRO स्‍वामी / Owner: ISRO अनुप्रयोग / Application: Communication कक्षा का प्रकार / Orbit Type: GSO (Geosynchronous Orbit) Mission Communication and Meteorology Spacecraft Mass 2,550 kg (Mass at Lift-off) 1150 kg (Dry mass) Launch date 03 April 1999 Launch site French Guyana Launch vehicle Ariane – 42P Orbit Geosynchronous (83 deg east longitude)"
