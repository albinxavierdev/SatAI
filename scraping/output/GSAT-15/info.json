Weighing 3164 kg at lift-off, GSAT-15 carried a total of 24 communication transponders in Ku-band as well as a GPS Aided GEO Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) payload operating in L1 and L5 bands. GSAT-15 is the third satellite to carry GAGAN payload after GAST-8 and GSAT-10, which are already providing navigation services from orbit. GSAT-15, carried a Ku-band beacon as well to help in accurately pointing ground antennas towards the satellite. GSAT-15 was launched by Ariane-5 VA-227 launch vehicle from Kourou, French Guiana on early morning of November 11, 2015 Mission Communication and Satellite Navigation Weight 3164 kg (Mass at Lift – off) 1440 kg (Dry Mass) Power Solar array providing 6200 Watts and Three 100 AH Lithium-Ion batteries Propulsion Bi- propellant System Launch date November 11, 2015 Launch site Kourou, French Guiana Launch vehicle Ariane-5 VA-227 Orbit Geostationary (93.5° East longitude) Co-located with INSAT-3A and INSAT-4B Mission life 12 Years"
