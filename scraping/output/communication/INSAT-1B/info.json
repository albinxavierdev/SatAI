    "Back to ISRO Timeline When INSAT": "1B was launched on 30 August 1983, it almost suffered the same fate as the INSAT-1A. It was not until mid-September that Ford and Indian controllers succeeded in deploying its solar array. By then it had been stationed at 74°E in place of INSAT-1A. Full operational capability was achieved in October 1983. It continued to operate into 1990 with all its 4375 two-way voice or equivalent circuits in use. Around 36,000 earth images were returned.
