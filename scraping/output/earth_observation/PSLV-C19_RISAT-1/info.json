    "st flight (PSLV": "C19), launches India’s first Radar Imaging Satellite – RISAT-1 into a Polar Circular Orbit with an altitude of 480 km (+ 40.5 km) and orbital inclination of 97.552 (+ 0.2). RISAT-1 weighing 1858 kg is the heaviest satellite being launched by PSLV. This is the third flight of the high end version (PSLV-XL) with six extended strap-on motors, each carrying 12 tonnes of solid propellant. (The two earlier flights of PSLV-XL were used to launch Chandrayaan-1 and GSAT-12 Communication Satellite) More Details PSLV-C19/RISAT-1 RISAT-1 Gallery RISAT-1 High Resolution SpotLight RISAT-1 Hybrid polarimetry image Brochure PDF - 3.33 MB PSLV- C19 Stages at a Glance STAGE-1 STAGE-2 STAGE-3 STAGE-4 Nomenclature Core Stage (PS1) + 6 Strap-on Motors PS2 PS3 PS4 Propellant Solid (HTPB Based) Liquid (UH25 + N2O4) Solid (HTPB Based) Liquid (MMH + MON-3) Mass (Tonne) 138.0 (Core), 6 x 12.0 (Strap-on) 41.7 7.6 2.5 Max Thrust (kN) 4819 (Core), 6 x 716 (Strap-on) 804 240 7.3 X 2 Burn Time (sec) 101.5 (Core), 49.5 (Strap-on) 149 112.1 523 Stage Dia (m) 2.8 (Core), 1.0 (Strap-on) 2.8 2.0 2.8 Stage Length (m) 20 (Core) 14.7 (Strap-on) 12.8 3.6 2.6"
