    "Back to ISRO Timeline The GSLV": "D3 was the sixth flight of ISRO's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) as well as its third developmental flight. In this flight, GSLV was to launch 2220 kg GSAT-4, an experimental advanced technology communication satellite. GSLV-D3 was the maiden flight of GSLV in which the indigenous Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS) was used. GSLV-D3 was launched from the Second Launch Pad (SLP) at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota on April 15, 2010. Flight testing of the Indigenous Cryogenic Stage was unsuccessful.
